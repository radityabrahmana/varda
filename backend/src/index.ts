/**
 * Where background work runs, relative to this API process:
 *   "thread" (default) — a worker_thread in this process: queue workers and
 *            maintenance run off the main event loop, so a CPU-heavy job can
 *            never starve HTTP requests, with zero deployment changes.
 *   "inline" — on the main thread (the historical behavior; escape hatch,
 *            e.g. if a platform disallows worker_threads).
 *   "none"  — not here at all: a standalone worker process (src/worker.ts)
 *            runs them — a separate container or machine on the same
 *            Postgres/Redis.
