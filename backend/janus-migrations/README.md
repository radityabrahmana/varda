# Janus-side migrations (Varda Supabase, applied by hand)

The contract-review tables (`reviews`, `review_feedback`, `manual_comments`,
`missed_clause_feedback`, `clause_library`, `clause_versions`,
`negotiation_points`, `playbook_rules`, `user_roles`, `clients`) were created in
Varda's Supabase from the Janus schema (2026-06-21) and are intentionally NOT part
of `backend/schema.sql` or `backend/migrations/`: upstream's fresh-install CI has
no Janus tables, so any `alter table reviews …` there would break it.

Apply these files in filename order in the Supabase SQL editor of the Varda
project, and record the last applied filename in the migration handoff doc.
Every file is idempotent (`if not exists` / `add column if not exists`).

Later Dash-side additions that follow the same convention: `review_access_grants`,
`review_suggestions`, `review_revision_edits`, and the regulation library
(`regulations`, `regulation_nodes`, `search_regulation_nodes()`; see
`docs/regulation-library.md`).
