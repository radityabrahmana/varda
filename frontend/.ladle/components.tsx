 * Varda's dark mode is class-based — `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` in

 * Settings > Appearance preference. Ladle's theme toggle only flips its own
 * global state, so it has to drive the same class or every dark-mode token in
 * the catalog stays on its light value.
 *
 * `ladle-canvas` is plain CSS in ladle.css, not Tailwind: this file sits in a
 * dot-directory, which Tailwind v4 does not scan. See ladle.css.
