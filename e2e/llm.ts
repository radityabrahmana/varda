/**
 * Helpers for specs that require a live LLM turn.
 *
 * Four specs (chat rename, chat delete, project-assistant create+submit, and
 * the critical-path "ask a question" flow) create/populate a chat by sending a
 * message. Varda supports keyless local models through Ollama, but the GitHub
 * Actions job does not provision an Ollama server or pull a model. Its only
 * live model is therefore the Anthropic model enabled by ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
 * Without that secret, these specs cannot submit a message in CI and would
 * otherwise hang until their timeout.
 *
 * The auto title-generation call (POST /chat/:id/generate-title) is NOT why
 * the gate exists: keyless it just returns 500, and the specs already treat it
 * as best-effort (`.catch(() => null)`).
 *
 * In CI the key is the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret, which
 * `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` exposes both to the backend (backend/.env) and
 * to the Playwright process. Guarding with
 * `test.skip(!hasLlmKey, LLM_SKIP_REASON)` keeps a keyless run (a plain local
 * run without Ollama, or a fork PR with no secret access) green on the other 27
 * specs, while still running — and enforcing — the LLM specs whenever the key
 * is present. Setup steps: docs/e2e-ci.md, "Enable the LLM specs".
 *
 * When the key IS set, the specs' selectClaudeModel helper picks "Claude
 * Sonnet 4.6" in the ModelToggle (see docs/e2e-ci.md, "Model selection"), so
 * the unskipped specs submit against a model this repository actually ships.
